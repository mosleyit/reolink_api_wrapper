# Full Canonical Restructure - Decision Summary

## Overview

This document provides a high-level summary to help you decide whether to proceed with the full canonical restructure of the Reolink Go SDK.

---

## What You're Getting

### Current State
```
‚ùå Non-standard structure (sdk/go/reolink/)
‚ùå Long import path
‚ùå Flat file organization (36 files in one directory)
‚ùå No LICENSE file
‚ùå No CHANGELOG
‚úÖ Works perfectly
‚úÖ 100% API coverage
‚úÖ Well tested (60% coverage)
```

### After Restructure
```
‚úÖ Canonical Go SDK structure
‚úÖ Short, clean import path
‚úÖ Organized by domain (api/, internal/, pkg/)
‚úÖ LICENSE included
‚úÖ CHANGELOG.md
‚úÖ Industry best practices
‚úÖ Works perfectly
‚úÖ 100% API coverage
‚úÖ Well tested (60% coverage)
```

---

## The One Breaking Change

**Import path changes:**

```go
// Before (v1.x)
import "github.com/mosleyit/reolink_api_wrapper/sdk/go/reolink"

// After (v2.0)
import "github.com/mosleyit/reolink_api_wrapper"
```

**That's it.** Everything else stays the same.

---

## User Impact

### What Users Must Change
1. Update `go.mod`: `go get github.com/mosleyit/reolink_api_wrapper@v2`
2. Update import statement (one line)
3. Run `go mod tidy`

### What Users Don't Need to Change
- ‚úÖ Client creation: `reolink.NewClient()` - same
- ‚úÖ Authentication: `client.Login()` - same
- ‚úÖ API calls: `client.System.GetDeviceInfo()` - same
- ‚úÖ All types: `DeviceInfo`, `StreamType`, etc. - same
- ‚úÖ All options: `WithCredentials()`, `WithTimeout()` - same
- ‚úÖ Error handling - same
- ‚úÖ Everything else - same

**Migration time for users: 2-5 minutes**

---

3. **Documentation** - Update all docs and examples
4. **Risk** - Potential for bugs during migration

### Ongoing Costs
1. **User migration** - Users must update imports
2. **Support** - Answer migration questions
3. **Dual maintenance** - May need to support v1.x briefly

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
- Public API unchanged
- All tests will be migrated
- Can test thoroughly before release
- Can maintain v1.x branch if needed

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Complex refactoring (many files)
- Import path changes affect all users
- Requires careful testing

### High Risk ‚ùå
- None (if done carefully)

**Overall Risk: LOW-MEDIUM** with proper testing

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Option A: Do Nothing
**Pros:**
- No work required
- No breaking changes
- Users unaffected

**Cons:**
- Non-standard structure persists
- Long import path remains
- Harder to maintain long-term
- Less professional appearance

**Verdict:** ‚ùå Not recommended - technical debt accumulates

---

### Option B: Minimal Changes (Add LICENSE, CHANGELOG only)
**Pros:**
- Quick to implement (1-2 hours)
- No breaking changes
- Improves project basics

**Cons:**
- Doesn't fix structure issues
- Import path still long
- Organization still flat

**Verdict:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Better than nothing, but doesn't solve core issues

---

### Option C: Partial Restructure (Move to root, keep flat)
**Pros:**
- Shorter import path
- Less refactoring work (4-6 hours)
- Still a breaking change anyway

**Cons:**
- Still flat structure
- Doesn't follow best practices
- Will want to restructure later anyway

**Verdict:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Half-measure - if breaking anyway, go all the way

---

### Option D: Full Canonical Restructure (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Industry-standard structure
- Best long-term solution
- Professional appearance
- Easier to maintain
- Simpler import path

**Cons:**
- Most work (12-18 hours)
- Breaking change
- Users must update imports

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED** - Best long-term investment

---

## Recommendation

### Proceed with Full Canonical Restructure (Option D)

**Why:**
1. **You're breaking anyway** - If you move to root (shorter import), that's already a breaking change. Might as well do it right.

2. **Better long-term** - Canonical structure is easier to maintain and extend as the SDK grows.

3. **Professional** - Shows attention to quality and Go best practices.

4. **One-time cost** - Users only need to update imports once. Better to do it now than later.

5. **Low risk** - Public API stays the same, so migration is simple for users.

**When:**
- Now is the perfect time - before SDK gains wider adoption
- Easier to break early than after many users depend on it

**How:**
- Follow the detailed plan in `RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md`
- Test thoroughly at each phase
- Maintain v1.x branch for legacy support if needed

---

## Timeline

### Fast Track (Focused Work)
- **1-2 days** of dedicated work
- Requires focus and minimal interruptions
- Test as you go

### Normal Pace (Part-Time)
- **1 week** working a few hours per day
- More time for testing and validation
- Lower risk of mistakes

### Conservative (Careful)
- **2 weeks** with thorough testing
- Hardware validation at each step
- Maximum confidence

**Recommended: Normal Pace (1 week)**

---

## Success Criteria

Before releasing v2.0.0, ensure:

- [ ] All 157 unit tests pass
- [ ] Test coverage ‚â• 60%
- [ ] All 3 examples build and run
- [ ] `go mod verify` succeeds
- [ ] `go vet ./...` passes with no issues

## Questions to Answer

Before starting, decide:

1. **License**: MIT or Apache 2.0?
   - **Recommendation**: MIT (simpler, more permissive)

2. **Version**: v2.0.0 or v1.0.0?
   - **Recommendation**: v2.0.0 (breaking change from current)

3. **v1 support**: How long to maintain v1.x?
   - **Recommendation**: 6 months, critical fixes only

4. **HTTP refactor**: Full extraction or minimal?
   - **Recommendation**: Full extraction to `internal/httpclient`

5. **Type organization**: All in common/ or split by domain?
   - **Recommendation**: Split by domain (better organization)

---

## Next Steps

### If You Decide to Proceed

1. **Read the detailed plan**
   - Review `RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md`
   - Understand each phase
   - Note the file mappings

2. **Set up environment**
   - Create backup branch
   - Ensure tests pass currently
   - Have hardware for testing (optional but recommended)

3. **Start Phase 1**
   - Create directory structure
   - Add new files (LICENSE, CHANGELOG, etc.)
   - No breaking changes yet

4. **Follow the phases**
   - One phase at a time
   - Test after each phase
   - Commit frequently

5. **Final validation**
   - Run all tests
   - Build all examples
   - Test with real camera if possible

6. **Release**
   - Tag v2.0.0
   - Update documentation
   - Announce changes

### If You Decide Not to Proceed

1. **Minimal improvements**
   - Add LICENSE file
   - Add CHANGELOG.md
   - Update documentation

2. **Plan for future**
   - Consider restructure for v2.0 later
   - Document technical debt
   - Set timeline for revisit

---

## Final Thoughts

This restructure is about **investing in the future** of the SDK. The one-time cost of refactoring and user migration is outweighed by:

- Long-term maintainability
- Professional appearance
- Easier contribution
- Better user experience
- Industry best practices

The public API remains identical, so users only need to update one line (the import). That's a small ask for a much better SDK structure.

**The time to do this is now** - before the SDK gains wider adoption and breaking changes become more costly.

## Recommendation: ‚úÖ PROCEED

**Confidence Level: HIGH**

The benefits far outweigh the costs. This is the right change at the right time. The SDK will be better for it, and users will appreciate the professional, standard structure.

**Estimated ROI:**
- **Cost**: 12-18 hours of work + user migration time
- **Benefit**: Years of easier maintenance and better developer experience
- **Payback**: Immediate (better structure) + ongoing (easier to maintain)

**Go for it!** üöÄ
